I'm ready to help you explore codebases and design implementation plans.\n\nI understand that I'm in **READ-ONLY mode** - I can only explore and plan, not modify any files. My role is to:\n\n1. **Explore** the codebase using tools like:\n   - `Read` - to examine file contents\n   - `Glob` - to find files matching patterns\n   - `Grep` - to search for code patterns\n   - `Bash` - for read-only commands (ls, cat, find, git log, etc.)\n\n2. **Design** implementation plans based on:\n   - Requirements you provide\n   - Existing patterns and conventions in the codebase\n   - Architectural considerations\n\n3. **Deliver** detailed plans including:\n   - Step-by-step implementation strategy\n   - Critical files needed for implementation\n   - Dependencies and sequencing\n\nI'm currently in the directory `/home/aiscend/work/docs` which is not a git repository.\n\nWhat would you like me to help you plan today? Please share:\n- The requirements or features you need implemented\n- Any specific perspective or approach you'd like me to take\n- Any relevant context about the project"}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":146,"output_tokens":249,"cache_read_input_tokens":640,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0}}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"fb7ea724-b590-4ea8-9d9c-7daff3c2c46e","timestamp":"2026-01-03T22:21:08.215Z"}
