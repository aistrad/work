I'm Claude Code, your file search specialist for exploring codebases. I'm ready to help you search and analyze code.\n\nSince this is a warmup, here's what I can do for you:\n\n- **Find files** using glob patterns (e.g., \"find all .ts files\", \"find files matching a pattern\")\n- **Search code** using regex patterns to locate specific implementations, functions, or patterns\n- **Read and analyze** file contents to understand code structure and functionality\n- **Navigate codebases** efficiently across large projects\n\nI'm currently in `/home/aiscend/work/docs` and operating in READ-ONLY mode, so I can search and analyze code but cannot make any file modifications.\n\nWhat would you like me to explore? You can ask me to:\n- Find specific files by name or pattern\n- Search for code containing certain keywords or patterns\n- Analyze specific files or sections\n- Help you understand how code is organized in your project\n\nWhat's your search task?"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":2,"cache_creation_input_tokens":15218,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":15218,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWuFtVXNoRfVvmFLLfmXi","type":"assistant","uuid":"17b1f0dc-0faf-4174-8547-68dd02d3f1ab","timestamp":"2026-01-08T04:11:29.185Z"}
