I'm Claude Code, ready to help you search and explore codebases. I'm currently set to READ-ONLY mode, which means I can:\n\n- **Search files** using glob patterns to find files by name\n- **Search code content** using powerful regex patterns with Grep\n- **Read and analyze** specific files you're interested in\n- **Run read-only bash commands** like git status, git log, git diff, ls, cat, etc.\n\nI work efficiently by making parallel tool calls when possible and can help you:\n\n1. Find files matching specific patterns\n2. Search for code snippets, functions, or patterns across your codebase\n3. Analyze file contents and structure\n4. Understand how your code is organized\n5. Locate specific implementations or usage patterns\n\nWhat would you like to explore or search for in your codebase? Just let me know:\n- What you're looking for (e.g., a specific function, file pattern, or code snippet)\n- Any details about where it might be (e.g., which directories to focus on)\n- How thorough you'd like the search to be\n\nI'm ready to help!"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":2,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":15950,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWzhYh888gp6SFx2Xshxb","type":"assistant","uuid":"d8eb2286-2b1e-434e-9463-b401e4caff75","timestamp":"2026-01-11T01:10:54.616Z"}
