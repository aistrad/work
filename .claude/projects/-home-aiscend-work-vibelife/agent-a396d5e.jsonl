Let me start by examining the project layout.\n\n```bash\nfind /home/aiscend/work/vibelife -type f -name \"*.md\" | head -20\n```\n\n```bash\nls -la /home/aiscend/work/vibelife/\n```\n\n```bash\nls -la /home/aiscend/work/vibelife/apps/\n```\n\n```bash\nls -la /home/aiscend/work/vibelife/apps/api/\n```\n\n```bash\nls -la /home/aiscend/work/vibelife/apps/web/src/\n```\n\nI've completed a warmup exploration of the codebase. Here's what I found:\n\n## Project Overview: VibeLife\n\nThis is a monorepo project with the following structure:\n\n### Root Level\n- `/home/aiscend/work/vibelife/` - Main project directory\n- Contains `apps/` directory with `api/` and `web/` subdirectories\n- Has `knowledge/` directory for domain knowledge (bazi, zodiac)\n- Uses `migrations/` for database schema\n\n### API (Python/FastAPI)\nLocated at `/home/aiscend/work/vibelife/apps/api/`:\n- `main.py` - Application entry point\n- `routes/` - API endpoints (chat, fortune, payment, relationship, report)\n- `services/` - Business logic (extraction, fortune, greeting, interview, relationship, report, vibe_engine)\n- `stores/` - Data repositories (conversation, message, payment, profile)\n- `tests/` - Integration tests\n\n### Web (Next.js/TypeScript)\nLocated at `/home/aiscend/work/vibelife/apps/web/src/`:\n- `app/` - Next.js app router pages\n- `components/` - React components (chat, chart, core, fortune, greeting, identity, interview, layout, relationship, report, script, trend, ui, upload, vibelife)\n- `providers/` - React context providers\n- `middleware.ts` - Next.js middleware\n\n### Key Observations\n1. The project appears to be a fortune-telling/personality analysis application\n2. Uses Clerk for authentication (SSO callback page exists)\n3. Has a \"vibe engine\" as core service\n4. Supports multiple analysis systems (bazi, zodiac, MBTI - though some are being removed based on git status)\n5. Recent work focuses on chat UI enhancements and schema migrations\n\n### Critical Files for Implementation\n- `/home/aiscend/work/vibelife/apps/api/main.py` - API entry point and route registration\n- `/home/aiscend/work/vibelife/apps/api/services/vibe_engine/__init__.py` - Core engine logic\n- `/home/aiscend/work/vibelife/apps/web/src/app/page.tsx` - Main web entry point\n- `/home/aiscend/work/vibelife/apps/web/src/components/chat/ChatContainer.tsx` - Primary chat interface\n- `/home/aiscend/work/vibelife/migrations/001_v3_schema.sql` - Current database schema","type":"text"}],"id":"msg_b76d0cdfb8e14d5ca0427b793ec448be","model":"claude-opus-4-5-20251101","role":"assistant","stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"type":"message","usage":{"cache_creation_input_tokens":1849,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"input_tokens":3201,"output_tokens":1}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"d103cb98-b03f-457d-b00f-32e4b6df2cb4","timestamp":"2026-01-07T13:15:55.809Z"}
