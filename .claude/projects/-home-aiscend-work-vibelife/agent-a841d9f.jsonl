For example:\n- Explore a specific feature or component\n- Design a new feature implementation plan\n- Analyze the current architecture\n- Review code patterns and conventions\n- Plan refactoring or improvements\n\nPlease share your requirements and any perspective you'd like me to apply during the design process."}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":2105,"output_tokens":294,"cache_read_input_tokens":11776,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0}}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"d6a65cc0-66c8-4f35-8874-0098635e2c0c","timestamp":"2026-01-08T12:01:32.772Z"}
