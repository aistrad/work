# Planning-with-Files: Core Architecture & Design

## Core Design Philosophy

This project implements a **context engineering pattern** inspired by Manus AI's $2B acquisition. The fundamental principle treats the filesystem as persistent memory and the context window as volatile RAM:

> "Markdown files serve as scratch pads for notes, checkpoints for progress, building blocks for final deliverables"

## Three-File Architecture

The solution organizes complex tasks into three complementary markdown documents:

1. **task_plan.md** - Structured phases with checkpoint tracking and progress indicators
2. **findings.md** - Persistent research storage, preventing context duplication
3. **progress.md** - Session logs documenting attempts, errors, and outcomes

## Implementation Strategy

**Automatic Activation**: The skill integrates via hooks at critical workflow junctures:
- **PreToolUse**: Re-reads the task plan before major decisions
- **PostToolUse**: Prompts users to synchronize discoveries after file operations
- **Stop Hook**: Verifies task completion before concluding sessions

**Session Recovery**: When context fills up and `/clear` executes, the system automatically recovers unsynced work from previous sessions by extracting conversation history after the last file update.

## Key Operational Rules

The pattern enforces discipline through:
- Mandatory plan creation before complex work begins
- The "2-Action Rule" for saving findings after every two operations
- Comprehensive error logging to prevent repeated failures
- Checkbox-based progress visualization

## Multi-IDE Support

Available across Claude Code, Cursor, Kilocode, Codex, OpenCode, FactoryAI, and Antigravity through platform-specific skill formats (v2.5.0 current).
