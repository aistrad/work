## Why Mobile Apps (Not Another SaaS)

**The B2B Trap**: Building $29/mo tools for indie hackers = B2C pricing with B2C users who:
- Are extremely picky
- Have "build it myself" mentality
- Compare everything to free open source

**The Truth**:
- B2B customer pays because it **makes them money**
- B2C customer pays because it **makes them feel something**: better, calmer, more confident, less anxious

Mobile apps are cracked because:
- Fastest-growing market in 2026
- AI makes complete apps buildable in a week
- Distribution is built-in (TikTok/Reels/Shorts = infinite reach)

## 1. Idea Discovery

### The TikTok Method

Scroll 5-10 min/day to understand:
- Gen Z language
- What they complain about
- What they flex about
- What they're insecure about

**Trends = Demand. Demand is the only thing that matters.**

### From Trend to App Idea

Don't build "[trend name] app". Build app that solves **emotional problem behind it**.

**Example**: "Underconsumption core" trend → Don't build "underconsumption app"

Build for the emotional root:
- "I spend money when I'm anxious"
- "I buy stuff to cope"
- "I don't realize how much I spend"
- "I need to romanticize saving money"

### 3 Idea Templates

| Template | Examples | Why It Works |
|----------|----------|--------------|
| **Tracker** | Spending, habit, mood, time | Gen Z loves numbers going up/down |
| **Coach** | Daily prompts, 7-day challenges, level-up systems | They want guidance, not tools |
| **Aesthetic Utility** | Minimalist notes, pretty timers, cute checklists | Vibes + function |

### Pro Tip: Money Signal Detection

Search "app" in TikTok comments.

If people say **"I need this as an app"** = validated demand.

## 2. Design Stealing

### The Screenshot Method

Download 10+ apps in your niche:
- Budgeting app → 10 budgeting apps
- Fitness app → 10 fitness apps
- Self-improvement → 10 self-improvement apps

Screenshot everything:
- [ ] Every screen
- [ ] Onboarding flow
- [ ] Paywall flow
- [ ] Settings
- [ ] Any "aha moment"

**You're not copying design. You're copying proven behavior design.**

These apps already spent thousands on:
- Conversion rate optimization
- Retention mechanics
- Onboarding psychology
- Paywall positioning

### Gen Z UI Cheat Codes

| Element | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| Theme | Dark mode by default |
| Typography | HUGE fonts |
| Copy | Minimal text |
| Personality | Emojis in headings (not too much) |
| Engagement | Progress bars everywhere |
| Retention | Streaks / levels / badges (dopamine) |

## 3. AI-Powered Building

### The Stack

**Tool**: [Rork](https://rork.app) - AI mobile app builder

**LLM Combo**:
- **Opus 4.5** for logic
- **Gemini 3 Pro** for UI/UX

### The Prompt Engineering Flow

**Step 1**: Prepare your inputs
- App idea (clear description)
- Competitor screenshots

**Step 2**: Generate spec with Claude/GPT

```
I'm building a mobile app: {describe your idea}.

Analyze these screenshots and adapt the UI/UX + user flow to my idea.
Make it improved to fit a Gen Z audience.

My goal is: {benefits of the app}.

Output a detailed prompt including:
- All screens
- Navigation structure
- Onboarding flow
- Core features (MVP only)
- 1 sticky loop for retention

Then format as a prompt I can send to Rork.
```

**Step 3**: Send to Rork with screenshots attached

### Key Mindset Shift

Don't ask AI to "build an app".

Ask AI to build like a **product designer**:
- User journey
- Friction removal
- Habit loop
- Retention triggers

---

## 4. Polish & Launch

### Onboarding (Critical)

Same screenshot method, but focused on onboarding flows.

**Goal**: User reaches value in **30 seconds**.

### Payments

Use Superwall integration in Rork.

**Standard pricing** (don't overthink):
- $4.99/week
- $29.99/year

### Testing

Test until you're bored:
- Every bug fix increases trust
- Every micro-polish increases conversions

### Launch Strategy

**DO**:
- Publish as soon as you can
- Launch on App Store first
- Collect feedback → iterate

**DON'T**:
- Wait for perfection (perfection is fake)
- Launch on Play Store initially (extra pain, half revenue)
