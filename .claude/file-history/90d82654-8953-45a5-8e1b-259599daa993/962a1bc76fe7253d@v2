"""
AI Interview System - Forced interview before report generation
Based on: vibelife spec v3.0, section 4.2

Core Principle: "生成报告前，必须完成访谈。"

The interview collects:
- Current concerns and pain points
- Life status (career, relationship)
- Expectations and goals

This ensures report quality - without user context,
even the best analysis is generic.
