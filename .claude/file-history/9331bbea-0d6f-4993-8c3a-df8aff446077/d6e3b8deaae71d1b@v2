# Mentis: The Living Companion
## Business Plan & Investment Thesis

---

## Executive Summary

**Mentis** is a next-generation AI companion platform that transcends traditional chatbots and productivity tools. We're building *"the friend you've always wanted but never had"* — an AI that deeply understands you, proactively cares for you, and evolves alongside your life journey.

### The Opportunity

The global mental wellness market is projected to reach $131B by 2030. Yet existing solutions fail to address a fundamental human need: **authentic, persistent connection with an entity that truly understands you**.

- ChatGPT/Claude: Powerful but stateless — every conversation starts fresh
- Therapy apps: Structured but impersonal — one-size-fits-all approaches
- Social media: Connected but superficial — algorithmic dopamine, not genuine understanding
- Journaling apps: Private but passive — storage without insight

**Mentis fills the gap**: A living companion that combines deep personalization, proactive care, and infinite extensibility through modular insight frameworks.

## Problem Statement

### The Loneliness Epidemic

- 61% of adults report feeling lonely (Cigna 2022)
- Average person has only 3 close confidants (down from 5 in 1985)
- Mental health apps have 96% churn within 30 days

### Why Current Solutions Fail

| Solution | Limitation |
|----------|------------|
| Traditional AI Assistants | No memory, no personality, reactive only |
| Mental Health Apps | Structured exercises feel like homework |
| Social Networks | Surface-level, algorithm-driven, not private |
| Human Therapy | Expensive ($150+/session), limited availability |
| Journaling | Passive storage, no active insight generation |

### The Unmet Need

Users crave a companion that:
- **Remembers everything** — your story is continuous, not episodic
- **Proactively cares** — reaches out when you need it, not just when you ask
- **Deeply understands** — knows your patterns, not just your words
- **Respects privacy** — a safe space for your authentic self

**Mentis is positioned to create a new category: The Living Companion.**

We're building at the intersection of:
- AI capability breakthrough (LLMs, memory systems)
