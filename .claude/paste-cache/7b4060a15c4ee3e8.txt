• Acknowledged. I merged everything into activate_skills across code and docs, keeping activate_skill only as a compatibility alias
  internally.

  What I changed

  - Tools exposure and logic
      - CoreAgent Phase 1 tools now only include activate_skills, ask, show; activate_skill is no longer exposed by Phase 1 tooling:
          - apps/api/services/agent/core.py: build_phase1_tools now returns [activate_skills, show, ask]; Phase 2 reuse also only
            injects activate_skills.
      - ToolExecutor maps old calls to new:
          - apps/api/services/agent/tool_executor.py:
              - activate_skill → mapped to _handle_activate_skill with skills=[...]
              - use_skill → mapped to skills=[...]
              - _handle_activate_skill now expects skills list; updates conversation skill to skills[0]; returns {skill, skills,
                rule, ...} with _should_reload_context via caller path.
      - Core handlers keep a narrow compatibility shim:
          - apps/api/skills/core/tools/handlers.py: activate_skill decorates to forward to activate_skills; added a doc comment
            noting alias is only for history replay.
  - Docs updated to “3 tools” and unified API
      - docs/archive/v9/LLM-FIRST-DESIGN.md:
          - Phase 1 可用工具 from “3+1” to “仅 3 个”; removed activate_skill from examples.
          - Top diagram updated “可用工具（3 个）”.
      - CONTEXT_LOSS_ANALYSIS.md: all examples now use activate_skills; fixed protocol_invitation earlier.
      - refs:
          - docs/archive/v9/ref/LLM_DRIVEN_ARCHITECTURE.md and docs/components/coreagent/LLM_DRIVEN_ARCHITECTURE.md updated to
            activate_skills throughout.
          - docs/archive/v9/ref/VIBE_CAPABILITY_BOUNDARY.md and docs/archive/v9/ref/LLM_DRIVEN_V9.1_PROFILE_TOOLS.md likewise
            migrated.
          - docs/archive/v9/ref/Ultra Analysis Report.md wording migrated.
  - Frontend small alignments
      - apps/web/src/skills/shared/SkillRecommendationCard.tsx: type changed to 'activate_skills'.
      - apps/web/src/components/chat/ChatMessage.tsx: whitelist updated to "activate_skills".
  - Housekeeping
      - apps/api/services/agent/init.py: comment lists only activate_skills, ask, show.
      - apps/api/services/agent/core.py headers/comments reflect activate_skills only in Phase 1.

  Left intentionally

  - We still accept activate_skill at the handler level for backward compatibility (old clients or historical conversation replay).
    It immediately delegates to activate_skills and is filtered from Phase 1 tool exposure and from streaming to the client
    (INTERNAL_TOOLS keeps “activate_skill” hidden in stream_adapter).
  - A few legacy documents not critical for runtime (e.g., test reports and analysis stubs) still mention historical function names
    to describe “old behavior” for audit purposes. If you want those scrubbed too, I can sweep them as well.

  Do you want me to:

  - Run a final repo-wide sweep to convert any remaining activate_skill mentions in non-historical docs?
  - Add a unit test ensuring Phase 1 tool list only contains activate_skills, show, ask and that activate_skill maps correctly for
    backward-compat?
