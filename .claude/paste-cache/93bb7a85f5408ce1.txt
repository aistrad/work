Complete. I removed activate_skill everywhere from the runtime path and consolidated on activate_skills, keeping only comments
  where we explicitly document removal.

  What I changed to “彻底清除”

  - handlers.py
      - apps/api/skills/core/tools/handlers.py: removed the @tool_handler("activate_skill") forwarder; left a comment noting we
        unified on activate_skills.
  - stream_adapter.py
      - apps/api/services/agent/stream_adapter.py: INTERNAL_TOOLS lists only activate_skills for routing; activate_skill entry is
        removed and commented as removed.
  - tool_executor.py
      - apps/api/services/agent/tool_executor.py:
          - Removed the activate_skill mapping branch entirely; only use_skill maps to activate_skills for legacy alias.
          - Renamed docstring for _handle_activate_skill to “处理 activate_skills 工具（统一入口）”.
  - core.py
      - apps/api/services/agent/core.py: throttle checks now apply only to activate_skills; Phase 1 tool exposure contains only
        [activate_skills, show, ask].

  Remaining mentions

  - A few historical documents (CONTEXT_LOSS_ANALYSIS.md, IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY_V10.2.md, SOP_MECHANISM_GUIDE.md, tarot/SKILL.md)
    still mention activate_skill to describe old behavior or examples. These are not executed; say if you want me to rewrite those
    narratives to use activate_skills as well.

  Repo check

  - Runtime code paths now have no active activate_skill handler or mapping.
  - use_skill still maps to activate_skills to avoid client breakage.
  - UI tool filtering hides activate_skills (router tool) from the stream.
