● The TypeScript error is fixed. Let me verify the full build passes.

● TypeScript build is now passing with no errors.                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                            
  Summary of Fixes                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                            
  Root Cause: There were two different SkillIntroCard components:                                                                           
  - SkillIntroCard.tsx - A simpler v11 implementation with onAction?: (action: { type: string; skillId?: string }) => void                  
  - SkillIntroCard/index.tsx - The full implementation with onAction?: (action: IntroCardAction) => void and dismissible prop               
                                                                                                                                            
  The import @/skills/shared/SkillIntroCard was resolving to the .tsx file instead of the directory.                                        
                                                                                                                                            
  Changes Made:                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                            
  1. ChatContainer.tsx (line 25):                                                                                                           
    - Changed import from @/skills/shared/SkillIntroCard to @/skills/shared/SkillIntroCard/index                                            
    - This ensures the full-featured component with proper types is used                                                                    
  2. ChatMessage.tsx (line 291-297):                                                                                                        
    - Added handleIntroAction handler with compatible signature for skill_intro cards rendered via CardRegistry                             
    - Updated line 327 to use handleIntroAction instead of the generic handleAction
