how to vibe code your first mobile app in 1 day
i know you’ve been watching everyone build mobile apps on X lately.
one day it’s “i shipped my first app in 48h”
the next day it’s “$3k/mo after 2 weeks”
then you open the replies and it’s 200 people saying:
“drop the stack”
“what tool?”
“how did you market it?”
and now you’re sitting there, staring at your phone, thinking:
“should i build apps too?”
quick answer: YES.
but if you’re still unsure because you’re “not a builder”…
or worse, you’re into b2b…
here’s why (and how) you can do it insanely fast.
b2b vs b2c (real talk)
people keep telling you:
“build b2b because churn is lower”
“it’s easier to sell”
“b2c users are broke”
and then what happens?
you end up building a $29/month tool for indie hackers.
maybe a social media scheduler. maybe an analytics dashboard. maybe another “ai ugc creator”.
funny thing: $29/month is b2c pricing.
so you’re already doing b2c.
you’re just doing it in the worst way possible.
because indie hackers are:
extremely picky
very “build it myself” mentality
allergic to paying
always comparing you to a free open source repo
so you’re b2c… but playing on hard mode.
and the biggest scam is: you think you’re doing b2b because it’s on a subscription.
but a subscription doesn’t make it b2b.
the user mindset does.
a b2b customer pays because it makes them money.
a b2c customer pays because it makes them feel something: better, hotter, calmer, more confident, less anxious, more productive.
and that’s exactly why mobile apps are cracked.
why you should build a mobile app (now)
mobile is the fastest-growing market in 2026
we’re about to see a boom in the mobile app economy
ai makes it ridiculously easy to build a complete app in a week
distribution is built-in (tiktok + reels + shorts = infinite reach)
and yes, i know what you’re thinking:
“but i’m not a designer”
“i’ve always built web apps with shadcn”
“i don’t know swift”
“i have no idea what to build”
perfect.
that’s literally the starting point.
let’s start from step one.
FIRST STEP
1) how to get a good idea (without being a genius)
this is the easiest method, tbh.
if you’re not chronically online (don't worry), your first step is:
download tiktok.
yes.
scroll 5–10 mins/day, not to waste your time, but to understand:
gen z language
what they complain about
what they flex about
what they’re insecure about
what they wish they were doing
because trends = demand.
and demand is the only thing that matters.
find a viral trend.
example: i found this trend called “underconsumption core”, where people talk about spending less money than usual.
if you search that keyword on tiktok, you’ll find hundreds of videos about it.
now here’s the trick:
don’t build an “underconsumption core app”.
build an app that solves the emotional problem behind it:
“i spend money when i’m anxious”
“i buy stuff to cope”
“i don’t even realize how much i spend”
“i need to romanticize saving money”
that’s how you extract app ideas from trends.
3 easy idea templates
template A: tracker
spending tracker
habit tracker
mood tracker
time tracker
gen z loves seeing numbers go up/down.
template B: coach
daily prompts
7-day challenges
“level up” systems
they want guidance, not tools.
template C: aesthetic utility
minimalist notes
pretty timers
cute checklists
they want vibes + function.
pro tip: search “app” in tiktok comments.
if people say “i need this as an app” = money signal.
2) how to design your idea (without being a designer)
we’re not designers.
we don’t know ui/ux.
but you can always steal like a good artist.
download 5, 10, 100 apps in your niche (or similar ones).
examples:
if you’re building a budgeting app → download 10 budgeting apps
if you’re building a fitness app → download 10 fitness apps
if you’re building a self-improvement app → download 10 self-improvement apps
then:
screenshot every screen
screenshot onboarding
screenshot paywall flow
screenshot settings
screenshot any “aha moment”
because these apps already spent thousands on:
conversion rate optimization
retention
onboarding psychology
paywall positioning
you’re not copying “design”.
you’re copying proven behavior design.
this is how everyone builds apps today:
take existing UI + add your personal touch.
quick UI cheat codes (gen z edition)
dark mode by default
huge typography
minimal text
emojis in headings (not too much)
progress bars everywhere
streaks / levels / badges (dopamine)
3) how to build your idea (fast, even if you can’t code)
i’ve used every trending tool: cursor, claude code, etc.
but for mobile apps my go-to is:
rork.
you’ve seen them everywhere on X (goated marketing).
but the tool is actually great, if you know how to use it.
recap: you now have
an app idea
screenshots from existing apps
next step:
send these infos to chatgpt / grok / claude and ask this:
“i’m building a mobile app: {describe your idea}.
now describe every detail from these screenshots and adapt the ui/ux + user flow to my idea.
i want it to be exactly like this, but improved to fit a gen z audience.
my goal is: {benefits of the app}.
then send me a prompt to recreate my app with these details.”
the output should include:
all screens
the navigation structure
onboarding flow
core features (MVP)
1 sticky loop to increase retention
then you take the prompt and send it to rork, with all screenshots attached.
BIGGEST ADVICE
use:
opus 4.5 for logic
gemini 3 pro for ui/ux
perfect combo.
and here’s a key tip:
don’t ask the model to “build an app”.
ask it to build an app like a product designer would:
user journey
friction removal
habit loop
retention triggers
4) how to improve your idea (after the first build)
this is the final step.
now you need to:
build onboarding
same process as before, but with onboarding screenshots.
your goal: make people reach value in 30 seconds.
add payments
ask rork to integrate superwall.
don’t overthink pricing:
$4.99/week
$29.99/year
classic.
test your app until you’re bored
every bug you fix increases trust.
every micro-polish increases conversions.
then:
PUBLISH AS SOON AS YOU CAN.
don’t wait for perfection. perfection is fake.
launch → collect feedback → iterate.
and remember:
launch only on app store
avoid play store at all costs (unless you want extra pain for half the revenue)
