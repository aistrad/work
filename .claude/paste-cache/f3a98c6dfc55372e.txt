Planning with Files
Work like Manus — the AI agent company Meta acquired for $2 billion.

Thank You
To everyone who starred, forked, and shared this skill — thank you. This project blew up in less than 24 hours, and the support from the community has been incredible.

If this skill helps you work smarter, that's all I wanted.

A Claude Code plugin that transforms your workflow to use persistent markdown files for planning, progress tracking, and knowledge storage — the exact pattern that made Manus worth billions.

Why This Skill?
On December 29, 2025, Meta acquired Manus for $2 billion. In just 8 months, Manus went from launch to $100M+ revenue. Their secret? Context engineering.

"Markdown is my 'working memory' on disk. Since I process information iteratively and my active context has limits, Markdown files serve as scratch pads for notes, checkpoints for progress, building blocks for final deliverables." — Manus AI

The Problem
Claude Code (and most AI agents) suffer from:

Volatile memory — TodoWrite tool disappears on context reset
Goal drift — After 50+ tool calls, original goals get forgotten
Hidden errors — Failures aren't tracked, so the same mistakes repeat
Context stuffing — Everything crammed into context instead of stored
The Solution: 3-File Pattern
For every complex task, create THREE files:

task_plan.md      → Track phases and progress
findings.md       → Store research and findings
progress.md       → Session log and test results
The Core Principle
Context Window = RAM (volatile, limited)
Filesystem = Disk (persistent, unlimited)

→ Anything important gets written to disk.
Usage
Once installed, Claude will automatically:

Create task_plan.md before starting complex tasks
Re-read plan before major decisions (via PreToolUse hook)
Remind you to update status after file writes (via PostToolUse hook)
Store findings in findings.md instead of stuffing context
Log errors for future reference
Verify completion before stopping (via Stop hook)
Or invoke manually with /planning-with-files.

See docs/quickstart.md for the full 5-step guide.

Session Recovery (NEW in v2.2.0)
When your context window fills up and you run /clear, this skill automatically recovers unsynced work from your previous session.

Optimal Workflow
For the best experience, we recommend:

Disable auto-compact in Claude Code settings (use full context window)
Start a fresh session in your project
Run /planning-with-files when ready to work on a complex task
Work until context fills up (Claude will warn you)
Run /clear to start fresh
Run /planning-with-files again — it will automatically recover where you left off
How Recovery Works
When you invoke /planning-with-files, the skill:

Checks for previous session data (stored in ~/.claude/projects/)
Finds the last time planning files were updated
Extracts conversation that happened after (potentially lost context)
Shows a catchup report so you can sync planning files
This means even if context filled up before you could update your planning files, the skill will recover that context in your next session.

Disabling Auto-Compact
To use the full context window without automatic compaction:

# In your Claude Code settings or .claude/settings.json
{
  "autoCompact": false
}
This lets you maximize context usage before manually clearing with /clear.

Key Rules
Create Plan First — Never start without task_plan.md
The 2-Action Rule — Save findings after every 2 view/browser operations
Log ALL Errors — They help avoid repetition
Never Repeat Failures — Track attempts, mutate approach

The Manus Principles
Principle    Implementation
Filesystem as memory    Store in files, not context
Attention manipulation    Re-read plan before decisions (hooks)
Error persistence    Log failures in plan file
Goal tracking    Checkboxes show progress
Completion verification    Stop hook checks all phases
When to Use
Use this pattern for:

Multi-step tasks (3+ steps)
Research tasks
Building/creating projects
Tasks spanning many tool calls
Skip for:

Simple questions
Single-file edits
Quick lookups
