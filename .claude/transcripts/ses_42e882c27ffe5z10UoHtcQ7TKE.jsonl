Likely widgets failing to fetch user data or daily fortune.\n    *   *Action*: Check Network tab for failing endpoints (e.g., `/api/user`, `/api/fortune`).\n\n### Priority 2: User Experience (Once Stable)\n1.  **Error Boundaries**: Implement React Error Boundaries (`error.tsx` in App Router) to show a friendly \"Something went wrong\" UI instead of a generic 500 crash.\n2.  **Loading States**: Ensure Skeletons are used while fetching data (currently observed \"Loading...\" text on Home could be improved to Skeletons).\n\n### Priority 3: Performance (Future)\n*   *Blocked*: Cannot assess performance (LCP, CLS) on crashing pages.\n*   **Home Page**: Visuals look complex (Gradients, Glassmorphism). Ensure `framer-motion` animations are optimized (use `layout` prop sparingly).\n\n## 4. Next Steps\n1.  Access server logs to confirm the cause of 500 errors.\n2.  Fix Auth configuration.\n3.  Re-run this analysis suite.\n# Frontend QA Analysis\n\n| Page | Status | Visual State | Console Errors |\n|------|--------|--------------|----------------|\n| /auth/login | ERROR (500) | Error | Check Logs |\n| /onboarding | ERROR (500) | Error | Check Logs |\n| /chat | OK (200) | Captured | None (Network) |\n| /identity | ERROR (500) | Error | Check Logs |\n| /membership | ERROR (500) | Error | Check Logs |\n| /settings | ERROR (500) | Error | Check Logs |\n| /report | ERROR (500) | Error | Check Logs |\n| /interview | ERROR (500) | Error | Check Logs |\n| /test | ERROR (500) | Error | Check Logs |\n| /relationship | ERROR (500) | Error | Check Logs |\n| /payment/success | ERROR (500) | Error | Check Logs |\n| /payment/cancel | ERROR (500) | Error | Check Logs |\n\n**Note**: Data collection was performed using a Python script fallback mechanism due to technical constraints with the Playwright MCP tool interface. Browser console logs are therefore not available, but HTTP status codes and response bodies were captured.\n# Home Page Analysis\n\n## Snapshot Summary\nThe home page renders a dashboard for \"VibeLife\" application.\n- **Header**: Contains Logo, Navigation (Home, Chat, Identity, Settings, Upgrade), Search, Notifications, User Profile.\n- **Greeting Section**: \"Good evening, User\", Date (2026-01-18), Daily Energy (甲子日, suitable for communication/study).\n- **Features Grid**:\n  - **Bazi (八字命盘)**: Available.\n  - **Constellation (星座解读)**: Available.\n  - **Tarot (塔罗占卜)**: Coming Soon.\n  - **Career Planning (职业规划)**: Coming Soon.\n- **Identity Prism**: \"My Identity Portrait\" section showing \"68% known\".\n- **Recent Conversations**: Lists recent chats about career, monthly fortune, relationship.\n- **Sidebar/Widgets**: Daily Fortune summary, Identity Prism progress, Notifications.\n\n## Console Errors\nThree `400 Bad Request` errors were detected in the console logs during page load. These likely indicate failed API calls for resources or data fetching (e.g., user profile, notifications, or widget data).\n\n## Recommendations\n- Investigate the 400 errors to ensure critical data isn't missing.\n- Verify if the \"Coming Soon\" features are intended to be non-interactive.\n- Check responsive layout (snapshot shows some content repetition which might be due to mobile/desktop view rendering in the text dump).\n","exit":0,"description":"Read content of all analysis files","truncated":false}}
